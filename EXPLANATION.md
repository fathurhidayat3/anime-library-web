# Explanation

## Tech Stack

- React : Unopiniated, fast, scalable framework with a great community support
- React Query : Offer caching feature in browser level (such as Apollo Client) but also proxy to API including REST
- CSS Module : This one is optional, but as I tried it was pretty powerful with combination of Atomic component structure and BEM naming convention
- Typescript : Better developer experience

## Pattern

- MV\* Pattern : Model and View separated for easier adaptation on API structure changes, can be improved especially on data fetching side
- BEM Convention : Declarative name and scoping

## Additional

- Caching with React Query to reduce API call and provide content faster
- Lazy Loading Image improve First Contentful Paint and User Experience
- Infinite Scroll Pagination for better user impression and discovery
- Unit Test to make sure to keep code maintanable
- PWA Support for installable app
